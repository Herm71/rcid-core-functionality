/**
 * Uninstall handler.
 *
 * Runs when the plugin is deleted from the Plugins screen — not on deactivation.
 *
 * POLICY: content outlives the plugin. The `projects`, `press` and
 * `testimonials` post types exist precisely so the site's content survives a
 * theme rewrite, and deleting the plugin must not undo that. Their posts, terms
 * and meta are left completely untouched. The post types simply stop being
 * registered, so the content becomes invisible in the admin until something
 * registers them again; it is not destroyed. Nothing here should ever delete a
 * post, and any future addition that does needs a deliberate decision and an
 * opt-in, not a quiet line in this file.
 *
 * What is removed is the plugin's own bookkeeping. The plugin stores no options
 * of its own; everything below belongs to plugin-update-checker, which caches
 * update metadata and schedules a cron event. PUC clears its cron on
 * deactivation, but deleting a plugin does not always deactivate it first, and
 * uninstall.php runs without the plugin loaded, so the names are hard-coded
 * here. They are derived from the slug passed to buildUpdateChecker() in
 * plugin.php — if that slug changes, these change with it.
 *
 * @package RCID_Custom_Functionality
 * @since   1.4.0
