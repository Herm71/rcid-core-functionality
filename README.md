This is WordPress plugin contains custom functionality for the [Ruth Chafin Interior Design](https://ruthchafininteriordesign.com) [WordPress Block Theme](https://github.com/Herm71/rcid-block-theme). The concept is to keep features of a site that are theme independent, such as custom post-types, taxonomies, and roles separate from the UCSC theme code. This will ensure that future theme changes do not affect a site's functionality.
